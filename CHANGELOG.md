### Added

- Seasons with the lip-sync assassin format will now apply the "if you're not in the top, you're in the bottom" twist after the Top 7

    - Table size has been modified to accommodate this change.

- Ties on the voting in the LSA format should now be way less common.
- Fixed favoritism and unfavoritism changing the outcome of possible double shantays and double sashays.
- In the All Stars and Lip-Sync Assassin format, if a queen lands on the Bottom 3 with a great performance, they will be low instead of being up to elimination.
- If a queen is disqualified, the trackrecord won't show the position they originally placed on the episode.
- Top All Stars that didn't win their lip-syncs will show on the track records as cyan instead of yellow.
- In All Stars and Lip-Sync Assassin format, queens will favor voting for queens that have been in the bottom a lot. They won't always vote like that, though.
- Fixed bug where, in Lip-Sync Assassin formats, queens' votes for elimination would not reset after simulating the season again.
- Rebalanced some queens' stats.
